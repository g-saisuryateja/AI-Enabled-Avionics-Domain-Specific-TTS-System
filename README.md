# AI-Enabled-Avionics-Domain-Specific-TTS-System

Existing state of
art TTS techniques are explored, various pretrained models are
trained and the quality of synthetic voice is assessed. Open-source
avionics related textual corpus is used to train and assess the
system. All the models are applied to a variety of audio generation
tasks. Spectrograms of generated audios were compared to that
of human generated audio spectrograms to assess how system
generated spectrograms could be developed further to improve
the quality of the synthetic voice.
